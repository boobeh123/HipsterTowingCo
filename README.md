## Lessons learned
This project has shown me that learning & understanding is displayed through building. 
There are several features I have seen for the first time. I had to learn more about it and implement in a way that fits the codebase in this project.
I experienced an undescribable feeling where I have watched this project grow from a blank page to where its at now. 
It came a long way and there is still so much more that can be added and improved on. 
I envision that this application has potential to become something with a global reach.
